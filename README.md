## C# Design Patterns: Singleton
### by Steve Smith

In this course, C# Design Patterns: Singleton, you’ll learn to apply the Singleton design pattern to enforce single instance behavior for certain classes. First, you’ll explore the need for limiting the number of instances of certain classes. Next, you’ll discover how to use the Singleton pattern to enforce this behavior. Finally, you’ll learn how to apply other (potentially better) approaches to solving this same class of problems. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of the Singleton design pattern needed to address the need to ensure certain classes only have a single instance in your applications.
